				<p>I'm a digital-focused designer with 10 years experience creating products, interfaces, services & experiences for the web. In that time I've worked for industries as diverse as cancer medication and cake making. </p>

				<p>I've got a deep passion for digital tools that get out of the way to help people make the most of their lives. I enjoy working across the whole product lifecycle, from initial brainstorming through to validation with users. I use data to inform my decisions whenever I can, but I'm equally capable of falling back on design principles.</p>

				<p>I was born in Bristol in the UK, but I left the hills behind a few years ago to move to Amsterdam. I'm currently working at Booking.com, where I've been creating the next generation of digital tools for accommodation providers.</p>
